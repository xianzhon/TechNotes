题目链接：[602. 好友申请 II ：谁有最多的好友 - 力扣（LeetCode）](https://leetcode.cn/problems/friend-requests-ii-who-has-the-most-friends/description/)

Table: `RequestAccepted`

```
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| requester_id   | int     |
| accepter_id    | int     |
| accept_date    | date    |
+----------------+---------+
(requester_id, accepter_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the ID of the user who sent the request, the ID of the user who received the request, and the date when the request was accepted.
```



Write a solution to find the people who have the most friends and the most friends number.

The test cases are generated so that only one person has the most friends.

The result format is in the following example.



**Example 1:**

```
Input:
RequestAccepted table:
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1            | 2           | 2016/06/03  |
| 1            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 2            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 3            | 4           | 2016/06/09  |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
Output:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 3  | 3   |
+----+-----+
Explanation:
The person with id 3 is a friend of people 1, 2, and 4, so he has three friends in total, which is the most number than any others.
```



**Follow up:** In the real world, multiple people could have the same most number of friends. Could you find all these people in this case?

## 2. 最佳思路

- 获取所有好友关系：使用 union，将单向的好友申请变成双向的
- 使用窗口函数，统计每个人的好友数量
- 使用排序，获取好友数量最多的一个，输出答案


## 3. 最佳代码

```sql
with t as (
    select requester_id as 'fromId', accepter_id as 'toId' from RequestAccepted
    union
    select accepter_id as 'fromId', requester_id as 'toId' from RequestAccepted
)
select id, num
from
	(select fromId as id, count(*) over (partition by fromId) as 'num'
	from t) tt
order by num desc limit 1;
```



### 其他解法

```sql
select id, count(*) as num
from
(
    select requester_id as id from RequestAccepted
    union all
    select accepter_id from RequestAccepted
) t
group by id
order by num desc
limit 1
```

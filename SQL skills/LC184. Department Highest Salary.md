Table: `Employee`

```
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| id           | int     |
| name         | varchar |
| salary       | int     |
| departmentId | int     |
+--------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
departmentId is a foreign key (reference columns) of the ID from the Department table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID, name, and salary of an employee. It also contains the ID of their department.
```



Table: `Department`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table. It is guaranteed that department name is not NULL.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of a department and its name.
```



Write a solution to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.



**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| id | name  | salary | departmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Jim   | 90000  | 1            |
| 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 4  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
Department table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | IT    |
| 2  | Sales |
+----+-------+
Output:
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
Explanation: Max and Jim both have the highest salary in the IT department and Henry has the highest salary in the Sales department.
```

## 2. 最佳思路

- use window function: dense_rank. very easy.

## 3. 最佳代码

使用窗口函数

```java
select d.name as 'Department', t.name as 'Employee', t.salary
from (
    select *, dense_rank() over (partition by departmentId order by salary desc) rnk
    from Employee
) t
inner join Department d on d.id = departmentId
where t.rnk = 1;
```



## 其他解法

利用：CTE (Common Table Expression) 得到一个临时结果集。
```sql
with t as (
    select departmentId, max(salary) as maxSalary
    from Employee
    group by departmentId
)
select d.name 'Department', e.name 'Employee', e.salary
from Employee e
inner join Department d on e.departmentId = d.id
inner join t on t.departmentId = e.departmentId and e.salary = t.maxSalary;
```

1. **首先执行 CTE**：计算每个部门的最高薪资，结果存储在临时表 `t` 中
	- 按 `departmentId` 分组
	- 计算每组的 `max(salary)`
2. **然后执行主查询**：连接三个表
	- `Employee` 表 (别名为 `a`) - 包含员工信息
	- `Department` 表 (别名为 `b`) - 包含部门信息
	- 临时表 `t` - 包含各部门最高薪资
3. **连接条件**：
	- `b.id = a.departmentId` - 连接部门表和员工表
	- `a.salary = t.mxs` - 员工薪资等于该部门最高薪资
	- `a.departmentId = t.departmentId` - 确保比较的是同一部门


CTE 本质上跟下面的写法是一模一样的：
```sql
select d.name 'Department', e.name 'Employee', e.salary
from Employee e
inner join Department d on e.departmentId = d.id
inner join
(
    select departmentId, max(salary) as maxSalary
    from Employee
    group by departmentId
) t
 on t.departmentId = e.departmentId and e.salary = t.maxSalary;
```

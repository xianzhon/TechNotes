题目链接：[550. 游戏玩法分析 IV - 力扣（LeetCode）](https://leetcode.cn/problems/game-play-analysis-iv/description/)

Table: `Activity`

```
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.
```



Write a solution to report the **fraction** of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, **rounded to 2 decimal places**. In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.

The result format is in the following example.



**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
Output:
+-----------+
| fraction  |
+-----------+
| 0.33      |
+-----------+
Explanation:
Only the player with id 1 logged back in after the first day he had logged in so the answer is 1/3 = 0.33
```



## 2. 最佳思路

- 理解题意，找到每个用户第一次登录的日期（一个子查询）
- 然后left join Activity 表，根据 datediff = 1 去关联。利用 avg 函数求比率。【很棒！】然后round 可以保留多少位小数。




## 3. 最佳代码

计算的是在首次登录后的第二天再次登录的玩家比例。
```sql
select round(avg(a.event_date is not null), 2) fraction
from
(select player_id, min(event_date) as login
    from activity
    group by player_id) t
left join activity a on t.player_id = a.player_id and datediff(a.event_date, t.login) = 1;
```

- 子查询：找出每个玩家的**首次登录日期**
- 在MySQL中，TRUE=1，FALSE=0，所以AVG实际上是计算比例

替代方案：
```sql
select
    round(
        sum(case when a.event_date is not null then 1 else 0 end) /
        count(distinct t.player_id),
    2) as fraction
from (...) t
left join activity a
  on t.player_id = a.player_id
  and datediff(a.event_date, t.login) = 1
```

使用 exists 子查询：
```sql
select
    round(
        sum(case when exists (
            select 1 from activity a
            where a.player_id = t.player_id
            and datediff(a.event_date, t.login) = 1
        ) then 1 else 0 end) /
        count(*),
    2) as fraction
from (...) t
```

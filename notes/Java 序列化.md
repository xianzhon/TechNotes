## **5W1H analysis** of **Java Serialization and Deserialization**:

- reading: [JavaGuide/docs/java/basis/serialization.md at main · Snailclimb/JavaGuide](https://github.com/Snailclimb/JavaGuide/blob/main/docs/java/basis/serialization.md)

### **1. What (是什么?)**
- **Serialization**: The process of converting a Java object into a byte stream (for storage or transmission).
- **Deserialization**: The reverse process—reconstructing a Java object from a byte stream.
- **Key Interfaces/Classes**:
  - `java.io.Serializable` (Marker interface)
  - `ObjectOutputStream` (for serialization)
  - `ObjectInputStream` (for deserialization)

### **2. Why (为什么需要?)**
- **Persistence**: Save object states (e.g., to a file or database).
- **Network Transmission**: Send objects over a network (e.g., RMI, HTTP).
- **Caching**: Store objects in memory (e.g., Redis) for faster retrieval.
- **Deep Copy**: Clone objects via serialization/deserialization.

### **3. When (何时使用?)**
- When objects need to be **stored** (e.g., session data in web apps).
- When objects are **transferred** between JVMs (e.g., microservices).
- When implementing **distributed systems** (e.g., Apache Kafka messages).

### **4. Where (在哪里使用?)**
- **File Storage**: Save/load objects to/from disk.
- **Databases**: Store objects as BLOBs.
- **Networking**: Transmit objects in RPC/RMI, HTTP APIs (though JSON/XML is more common today).
- **Caching Systems**: Redis, Memcached.

### **5. Who (谁使用?)**
- **Developers**: Implement serialization in applications.
- **Frameworks**: Hibernate (for lazy loading), Spring (session replication).
- **Distributed Systems**: Kafka, Akka, gRPC (alternative: Protobuf/JSON).

### **6. How (如何实现?)**
#### **Serialization Steps**:
```java
import java.io.*;

class Person implements Serializable {
    private String name;
    // ... (must implement Serializable)
}

// Serialize
try (ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("person.ser"))) {
    oos.writeObject(new Person("Alice"));
}
```

需要说明的是：
 - Serializable 是一个空接口，没有提供 API
> Classes that do not implement this interface will not have any of their state serialized or deserialized. All subtypes of a serializable class are themselves serializable. The serialization interface has no methods or fields and serves only to identify the semantics of being serializable.
>
> Classes that require special handling during the serialization and deserialization process must implement special methods with these exact signatures:
  private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream out)   throws IOException
  private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream in)  throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;
  private void readObjectNoData()   throws ObjectStreamException;

  The default mechanism for saving the Object's fields can be invoked by calling `out.defaultWriteObject`. The method does not need to concern itself with the state belonging to its superclasses or subclasses. State is saved by writing the individual fields to the ObjectOutputStream using the writeObject method or by using the methods for primitive data types supported by DataOutput.

The `defaultReadObject` method uses information in the stream to assign the fields of the object saved in the stream with the correspondingly named fields in the current object. This handles the case when the class has evolved to add new fields. The method does not need to concern itself with the state belonging to its superclasses or subclasses. State is restored by reading data from the ObjectInputStream for the individual fields and making assignments to the appropriate fields of the object. Reading primitive data types is supported by DataInput.



#### **Deserialization Steps**:
```java
try (ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("person.ser"))) {
    Person person = (Person) ois.readObject();
}
```
#### **Key Considerations**:
- **`serialVersionUID`**: Manually define it to avoid version mismatch errors.
- **Transient Fields**: Mark sensitive data (e.g., passwords) as `transient` to exclude from serialization.
- **Security Risks**: Deserialization can lead to vulnerabilities (e.g., `InvalidClassException`, RCE attacks). Use `ObjectInputFilter` (Java 9+) for validation.
- **Alternatives**: For better performance/safety, consider JSON (Jackson/Gson), XML, or Protobuf.

### **Summary of Risks & Best Practices**:
- **Avoid** serializing sensitive data.
- Prefer **immutable objects** where possible.
- Use **`Externalizable`** for custom control over serialization.
- Consider **alternatives** (JSON, Protobuf) for cross-platform compatibility.

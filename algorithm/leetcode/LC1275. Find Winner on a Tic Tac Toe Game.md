**Tic-tac-toe** is played by two players `A` and `B` on a `3 x 3` grid. The rules of Tic-Tac-Toe are:

- Players take turns placing characters into empty squares `' '`.
- The first player `A` always places `'X'` characters, while the second player `B` always places `'O'` characters.
- `'X'` and `'O'` characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
- The game ends when there are **three** of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
- The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
- No more moves can be played if the game is over.

Given a 2D integer array `moves` where `moves[i] = [rowi, coli]` indicates that the `ith` move will be played on `grid[rowi][coli]`. return *the winner of the game if it exists* (`A` or `B`). In case the game ends in a draw return `"Draw"`. If there are still movements to play return `"Pending"`.

You can assume that `moves` is valid (i.e., it follows the rules of **Tic-Tac-Toe**), the grid is initially empty, and `A` will play first.



**Example 1:**

![img](https://i.hish.top:8/2025/06/13/070245.jpg)

```
Input: moves = [[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: "A"
Explanation: A wins, they always play first.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://i.hish.top:8/2025/06/13/070245.jpg)

```
Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: "B"
Explanation: B wins.
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://i.hish.top:8/2025/06/13/070245.jpg)

```
Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[0,1],[0,2],[2,2]]
Output: "Draw"
Explanation: The game ends in a draw since there are no moves to make.
```



**Constraints:**

- `1 <= moves.length <= 9`
- `moves[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= rowi, coli <= 2`
- There are no repeated elements on `moves`.
- `moves` follow the rules of tic tac toe.










## 2. 最佳思路

- 优化的思路，跟 [LC348. Design Tic-Tac-Toe](../leetcode-vip/LC348.%20Design%20Tic-Tac-Toe.md) 一模一样。 【但如果 grid 是不规则的，那么这些优化就不行了】
## 3. 最佳代码

```java
class Solution {

    private static final int GRID_SIZE = 3;
    private int[] rowFlags = new int[GRID_SIZE];
    private int[] colFlags = new int[GRID_SIZE];
    private int diagFlag, antiDiagFlag;

    public String tictactoe(int[][] moves) {
        for (int i = 0; i < moves.length; i++) {
            String curPlayer = (i % 2 == 0) ? "A": "B";
            int playerScore = curPlayer.equals("A") ? 1 : -1;
            int row = moves[i][0], col = moves[i][1];

            rowFlags[row] += playerScore;
            colFlags[col] += playerScore;
            if (row == col) diagFlag += playerScore;
            if (row + col == GRID_SIZE - 1) antiDiagFlag += playerScore;

            if (Math.abs(rowFlags[row]) == GRID_SIZE
                || Math.abs(colFlags[col]) == GRID_SIZE
                || Math.abs(diagFlag) == GRID_SIZE
                || Math.abs(antiDiagFlag) == GRID_SIZE) {
                // has winner
                return curPlayer;
            }
        }
        if (moves.length == GRID_SIZE * GRID_SIZE) {
            return "Draw";
        }
        return "Pending";
    }
}
```

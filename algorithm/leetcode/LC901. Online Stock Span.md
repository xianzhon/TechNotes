## 1. 题目
题目链接：[901. 股票价格跨度 - 力扣（LeetCode）](https://leetcode.cn/problems/online-stock-span/description/)

Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns **the span** of that stock's price for the current day.

The **span** of the stock's price in one day is the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from that day and going backward) for which the stock price was less than or equal to the price of that day.

- For example, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is `[7,2,1,2]` and the price of the stock today is `2`, then the span of today is `4` because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal `2` for `4` consecutive days.
- Also, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is `[7,34,1,2]` and the price of the stock today is `8`, then the span of today is `3` because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal `8` for `3` consecutive days.

Implement the `StockSpanner` class:

- `StockSpanner()` Initializes the object of the class.
- `int next(int price)` Returns the **span** of the stock's price given that today's price is `price`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["StockSpanner", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next"]
[[], [100], [80], [60], [70], [60], [75], [85]]
Output
[null, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]

Explanation
StockSpanner stockSpanner = new StockSpanner();
stockSpanner.next(100); // return 1
stockSpanner.next(80);  // return 1
stockSpanner.next(60);  // return 1
stockSpanner.next(70);  // return 2
stockSpanner.next(60);  // return 1
stockSpanner.next(75);  // return 4, because the last 4 prices (including today's price of 75) were less than or equal to today's price.
stockSpanner.next(85);  // return 6
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= price <= 10^5`
- At most `104` calls will be made to `next`.

## 2. 最佳思路

- 找这个 span 关键就是找左边第一个大于当前数的位置。所以可以用单调栈来做。


## 3. 最佳代码

```java
class StockSpanner {
    private List<Integer> nums;
    private Deque<Integer> stack;

    public StockSpanner() {
        nums = new ArrayList<>();
        stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
    }
    
    public int next(int price) { // time: O(1)
        while (!stack.isEmpty() && nums.get(stack.peek()) <= price) {
            stack.pop();
        }        
        int i = nums.size(); // 新加入的元素它的下标
        nums.add(price);
        int ans = stack.isEmpty() ? i + 1 : i - stack.peek(); // [peek, i]
        stack.push(i);
        return ans;
    }
}
```

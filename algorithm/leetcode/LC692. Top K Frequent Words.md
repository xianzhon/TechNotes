## 1. 题目
题目链接：[692. 前K个高频单词 - 力扣（LeetCode）](https://leetcode.cn/problems/top-k-frequent-words/description/)

Given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`, return *the* `k` *most frequent strings*.

Return the answer **sorted** by **the frequency** from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their **lexicographical order**.



**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i","love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
Output: ["the","is","sunny","day"]
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
```



**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 500`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `k` is in the range `[1, The number of **unique** words[i]]`



**Follow-up:** Could you solve it in `O(n log(k))` time and `O(n)` extra space?

## 2. 最佳思路

- Count the frequency and then maintain a minHeap of k elements

## 3. 最佳代码

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> topKFrequent(String[] words, int k) { // time: O(nlogk), space: O(n)
        List<String> ans = new ArrayList<>();

        // count word frequency
        Map<String, Integer> wordFreq = new HashMap<>();
        for (String word : words) {
            wordFreq.put(word, wordFreq.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
        }

        // maintain a minHeap with k elements
        PriorityQueue<String> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> {
            if (wordFreq.get(a) != wordFreq.get(b)) { // sort by frequency asc
                return Integer.compare(wordFreq.get(a), wordFreq.get(b));
            }
            return b.compareTo(a); // sort by alpha desc, because we will reverse it later
        });
        for (String word : wordFreq.keySet()) {
            minHeap.offer(word);
            if (minHeap.size() > k) {
                minHeap.poll();
            }
        }

        // construct the answer
        while (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
            ans.add(minHeap.poll());
        }
        Collections.reverse(ans);

        return ans;
    }
}
```
需要注意的是，minHeap 里面排序的时候，要根据 freq 升序排列，freq 相同的情况下，要按字典序逆序（因为后面需要 reverse minHeap 的内容）

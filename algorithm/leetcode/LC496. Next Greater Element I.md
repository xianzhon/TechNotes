The **next greater element** of some element `x` in an array is the **first greater** element that is **to the right** of `x` in the same array.

You are given two **distinct 0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, where `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`.

For each `0 <= i < nums1.length`, find the index `j` such that `nums1[i] == nums2[j]` and determine the **next greater element** of `nums2[j]` in `nums2`. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is `-1`.

Return *an array* `ans` *of length* `nums1.length` *such that* `ans[i]` *is the **next greater element** as described above.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^4`
- All integers in `nums1` and `nums2` are **unique**.
- All the integers of `nums1` also appear in `nums2`.

 

**Follow up:** Could you find an `O(nums1.length + nums2.length)` solution?

## 2. 思路

- native idea: Use a hashmap to store mapping of nums2 element with its index  O(m), so that we can use O(1) time to locate the number in nums2. Then use a for loop to find the first greater element in the right side in nums2 array. Time complexity: **O(nm)**
- Better idea:  total time: O(n + m)
	- We use a mon-stack to find out each element’s next greater element in the nums2 array: O(m)
	- In the meantime, we can map the element to its next greater element.
	- Iterate nums1 and output the answer: O(n)

## 3. 最佳代码

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElement(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) { // time: O(n+m), space: O(n)
        int m = nums1.length, n = nums2.length;
        
        Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        Map<Integer, Integer> nextGreaterMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && nums2[stack.peek()] < nums2[i]) {
                int idx = stack.pop();
                nextGreaterMap.put(nums2[idx], nums2[i]);
            }
            stack.push(i);
        }
        int[] ans = new int[m];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {            
            ans[i] = nextGreaterMap.getOrDefault(nums1[i], -1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

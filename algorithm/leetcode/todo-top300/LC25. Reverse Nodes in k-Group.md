Given the `head` of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a time, and return *the modified list*.

`k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k` then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://i.hish.top:8/2025/06/03/220055.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
- `1 <= k <= n <= 5000`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`

 

**Follow-up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra memory space?

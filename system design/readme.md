### [Episode 06: Intro to Architecture and Systems Design Interviews - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As2gOXtcPVQ)

> The fact is the architecture interview at most tech companies is the interview that determines what level of an offer you get. If we were going to put this person on the team, would they be the strongest technical contributor? Would they be the weakest? Would they be someone who can lead a team? Would they be someone who can lead many teams?
>
> The architecture interview in a lot of ways is really a judge of how much technical leadership ability you have and because of that it relates directyly to like literally how big of a number you get in your salary offer.
>
> Architecture interviews definitely assess your ability to be a technical leader. They are all about determining how adept you are at taking apart big problems and breaking them down into very **coherent** component problems.
>
> Architecture interviews give you the opportunity to expose a set of **broad** skills and also expect you to be very **detailed** about what you describe.
>
> The performance you give in the interview is about your ability to make progress through the problem with your own skill set, with your own understanding.

**Example problem**: You’ve got a user base of 500 million monthly active users who are using your services, given that build a logging infrastructure for your apps that makes it possible for your developers to log any arbitrary data from the app to the server that they want and need. Any kind of log data, like starting the app, stopping app, switching features, messages sent and received, whatever.
